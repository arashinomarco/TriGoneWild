Made this one out of a wacky idea and also boredom.

Context: Does this one need context? Lmao just kidding here's the original blog post: https://www.intmath.com/blog/mathematics/how-do-you-find-exact-values-for-the-sine-of-all-angles-6212

What we did is to make a repository of said exact values in TeX because why not?

Exact values compiled by Mary Heart Jillbeth Parena (*MHJ-Parena*) and Marc Andrie Bermundo (*washiwishiwashiwishi*)
